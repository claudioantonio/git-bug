	// - the Id of the first Operation will be used as the Id of the Entity. Collision need to be avoided across entities of the same type
	//   (example: no collision within the "bug" namespace).
	// - collisions can also happen within the set of Operations of an Entity. Simple Operation might not have enough
	//   entropy to yield unique Ids (example: two "close" operation within the same second, same author).
	// A common way to derive an Id will be to use the DeriveId function on the serialized operation data.
